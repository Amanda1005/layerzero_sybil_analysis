# üïµÔ∏è LayerZero Sybil Detection Analysis

This project analyzes Sybil behaviors on LayerZero by fetching transaction data, performing behavioral clustering, and scoring risk levels of each wallet address.


## Project Highlights

- **Analyzed 10,000 addresses**
- **Fetched 380,000+ transactions** from LayerZero API
- **Scored Sybil risk** using pathway similarity, time coordination, behavior, and network density
- **Interactive dashboard** for HR/PMs to explore risk levels, trends, and top pathways

## Dashboard Preview
